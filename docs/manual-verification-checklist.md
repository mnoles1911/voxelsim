# Manual verification checklist (PIE)

Written 2026-07-26 at the end of the GPU streaming wave. Everything here is a
thing **headless capture cannot answer** — either because it needs a moving
camera, a human eye, or a judgement about whether something "looks right".

Read the note at the bottom on why the automated method missed the ring-gap
symptom; it is the reason this file exists.

## Before you start

Current defaults, so you know what you are looking at without setting anything:

| cvar / switch | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `voxel.Stream.GPU` | **0** | terrain renders on the per-chunk component path |
| `voxel.Stream.GPUCull` | **0** | pooled frustum cull is off (it still drops geometry) |
| `voxel.Water.GPU` | 0 | water on the per-chunk path |
| `voxel.GI.Enabled` | 0 | voxel GI off |
| `voxel.GI.Volume` | 0 | GPU GI volume off |
| `-VoxelCoarseGrid` | on | coarse chunks use the flat-grid fast path |
| `-VoxelL0BrickSkip` | on | level-0 skips provably-empty bricks |

**Give the world time to settle.** The full 2 km cascade takes roughly 10–30 s
from spawn depending on machine. `voxel.Debug 1` shows a HUD; the world is
settled when `pending` is 0 on every ring and `jobs` reads 0.

## 1. The ring gaps — the one I could not reproduce

**This is the priority.** You reported concentric ring gaps while flying; my
20 m/s scripted flight on current main does not produce them, and the run where
I thought I saw them turned out to be a build linking a stale library.

1. Enter PIE, `voxel.Debug 1`, let the world settle.
2. Fly the way you normally do — the speed and direction that shows it.
3. **When you see a gap, stop moving and hold still.**
4. Note from the HUD/log: which ring boundary it sits at, and whether it **fills
   in** within a few seconds of stopping.

What the answer means:

- **Fills in when you stop** → streaming cannot keep up at your speed. It is a
  throughput/priority problem and the per-ring `loaded`/`pending` numbers in the
  log at that moment are the evidence I need.
- **Does NOT fill in when you stop** → it is not a speed problem at all. It is an
  admission or residency bug — a chunk that is never requested. Very different
  fix, and much more likely to be reproducible.

Either way, please grab the log (`ue-project/Saved/Logs/VoxelEarth.log`) — the
`Voxel rings:` and `Voxel ring dispatch:` lines around the moment are what
distinguish the two.

Also worth trying: fly the same path with `voxel.Stream.GPU 1`. If the gaps
differ between the two renderers, that localises it to rendering rather than
streaming.

## 2. Terrain appearance (the parity work)

Set `voxel.Stream.GPU 1`, restart PIE, settle.

- **Hillside risers** — every vertical step face should read as blended turf, not
  pink/tan. This was genuinely broken and is the one visual fix I am confident in
  (17.4% → 4.3% of pixels differing from the component path).
- **Cave floors** — go underground. Floors must **not** be grass-green. Same fix,
  other half.
- **A/B it**: `voxel.Stream.GPU 0`, restart, same spot. The two should be
  indistinguishable apart from a faint biome-tint gradient (the pooled path
  samples climate per chunk rather than per quad — known and accepted).

## 3. Frame cost, with the camera held still

The number I could never measure reliably in automation. Hold the camera
**completely still** and pointed at a dense view, then read `stat unit`.

1. `voxel.Stream.GPU 0` → note Frame / Draw / GPU.
2. Quit, `voxel.Stream.GPU 1`, return to the **same spot and same view
   direction**, settle, read again.

Holding the pose fixed is the whole trick — it is what my headless harness could
not do, and without it the run-to-run spread swamps the difference. Two identical
runs at an unpinned pose gave me 43 fps and 103 fps on the same settled scene.

Expect the pooled path to be **slower** here (~23% at p50, more when little is on
screen) because it has no per-chunk culling yet. That is known, measured, and why
it is not the default.

## 4. Water (optional)

`voxel.Water.GPU 1` needs an actual cavern lake — the default spawn's water is an
ocean plane the pool does not touch. `-VoxelFloodTest=70` sets one up. Look for
translucent water at the right waterline with the cavern floor visible through
it.

## 5. Digging (optional but valuable)

- Dig straight down more than ~40 m. The shaft should stay solid all the way; a
  see-through hole below ~41.6 m is the bug fixed this wave, and a regression
  there matters.
- Save, quit, reload, and look at the same shaft. Saved worlds used to lose
  structures above the sky-band trim.

## Why this file exists

Every screenshot I took was a **stationary camera on a settled world**. That
cannot show a movement-induced gap, which is exactly the symptom you reported. I
verified terrain was fully loaded in each capture (`jobsInFlight=0
pendingJobs=0`) and concluded the pictures were sound — and they were, for the
question they could answer. They simply could not answer yours.

Two other traps this wave, both worth knowing before trusting any number:

- **A stale `voxelcore.lib`** silently links an out-of-date generator and
  produces a different world. It sent two investigations into the wrong
  subsystem, and one of my own conclusions to you was drawn from a run affected
  by it. The build now warns; if you see that warning, rebuild voxel-core before
  believing anything.
- **Single runs lie.** Two identical configurations regularly differ more than
  the effect being measured. Nothing here should be concluded from one run.
