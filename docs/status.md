# Milestone gate status

Updated whenever gate-relevant work lands. See the implementation plan §4 for
gate definitions.

## M0 — Core + proof of numbers (IN PROGRESS)

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Amplify+mesh 128m radius < 1s on RTX 3060 | ⬜ open | CPU reference done; GPU compute port not started (needs GPU machine). Baseline (2026-07-19, single-threaded CPU ref, container hardware): 128m radius = **10.6s** with 8³ bricks, **14.9s** with 16³ (amplify 4.3s / mesh 5.9s dominate at 8³). GPU port + parallel columns must close ~10–15×, which is the expected shape of the win. |
| Bit-identical amplifier output NVIDIA vs AMD | 🟨 half-open | **AMD leg PASSING** (2026-07-19): `vxc_gpu` (voxel-core/bench/gpu_harness.cpp, ADR-0001) dispatches the SPIR-V worldgen kernel (build/shaders/worldgen.ColumnMain.spv) on this desktop's AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT via a headless Vulkan 1.1 harness and byte-compares every field of every column against `vxc::Amplifier::column` — bit-exact over 32,768 columns across two dispatch regions (near-origin and a far/negative-coordinate region), digest `be28ce960bd5bcf6`. NVIDIA leg still open: needs a rented/CI Linux+NVIDIA runner producing the same `vxc_gpu` digest (ADR-0001 gate = identical digest on both legs). Interim cross-*compiler* proxy (gcc/clang/MSVC digests) still green as a secondary signal; see `determinism-cross-compiler` in CI. |

### Early 8³ vs 16³ data (CPU ref, will re-decide after GPU port)

At 128m radius: 8³ = 129.7k surface-shell bricks, 36.5M solid voxels, 4.53M
quads, 10.6s total; 16³ = 32.5k bricks, 69.9M solid voxels (taller bricks
capture more buried volume), 4.35M quads, 14.9s (meshing 16³ slices costs
~2× despite 4× fewer bricks). CPU ref favors 8³ on generation cost; final
call needs GPU meshing + render/memory numbers (M1).

### M0 task checklist (plan §5)

- [x] Repo scaffold (monorepo layout, docs, CI)
- [x] Tile API: `GET /tile?seed&x&y&scale` → elevation int16 + climate uint8[4]; disk cache; golden-tile regression test (synthetic provider; real terrain-diffusion worker pending GPU machine)
- [x] Brick storage + palette + bitmask; property tests; 8³ vs 16³ benchmark
- [x] Amplifier v0: column stratigraphy + integer-hash fractal detail (fixed-point only, hash documented in docs/determinism.md). CPU reference first; GPU port pending
- [x] Greedy mesher (CPU ref); bricks/sec + 128m-radius wall-clock in bench
- [x] Edit overlay + append-only log format (versioned, RLE brick diffs) + replay test
- [ ] terrain-diffusion worker running (GPU machine)
- [x] GPU compute port of amplifier (worldgen.hlsl ColumnMain, Vulkan harness verified bit-exact on AMD leg); mesher GPU port still pending
- [ ] Cross-vendor (NV vs AMD) determinism CI (AMD leg passing locally; NVIDIA leg needs a rented/CI runner)

## M1 — Walkable world in UE5 (IN PROGRESS, stages 1–2 verified on screen)

Working plan + binding decisions: docs/m1-plan.md. UE 5.8.0 (retargeted
2026-07-19), native editor MCP enabled.

- [x] Stage 1 — voxels on screen: custom scene proxy (FLocalVertexFactory),
  vertex-color AO material, verified by screenshot 2026-07-19
- [x] Stage 2 — streaming + dig/place: lock-free worker split, budgets,
  hysteresis, DDA raycast digs through the edit-log authority path
- [ ] Stage 3 — walkable + LWC: streaming perf (worker column caching —
  measured ~5 chunks/s, needs ~10×), DDA box-sweep character collision,
  origin rebasing, 60fps gate run
- Gate (walk & dig at 60fps min-spec): ⬜ open — blocked on stage 3

## M0 GPU track (ADR-0001)

- [x] Worldgen HLSL kernel (ColumnMain) mirrors CPU reference; compiles to
  DXIL + SPIR-V from one source (pinned DXC 1.9, tools/compile-shaders.ps1)
- [ ] Vulkan headless harness: dispatch + byte-compare vs CPU reference on
  the AMD leg (this desktop), then a cloud NVIDIA leg → closes both M0 gates

## Water track — W1 first slice landed (2026-07-19)

Implicit ocean (z<0, zero voxel data): `AVoxelOceanActor` (camera-following
40km `/Engine/BasicShapes/Plane`, `M_Ocean` via `Tools/create_ocean_material.py`),
underwater fog/post-process tint toggled by camera depth (log-verified
transition, no screenshot), swim-mode placeholder in `AVoxelEarthFlyPawn`
(gravity off, fly-style 300 UU/s below sea level). No pressure CA, reservoirs,
buoyancy, or currents yet -- those are W2-W4.
